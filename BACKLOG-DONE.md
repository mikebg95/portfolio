## Pruned from the queue

2 finished task(s), moved verbatim by `prune-backlog.py` so the live queue holds only live work.

### Foundation

- [x] **PR-1 Scaffold the Astro app and record the stack**
  - Done when: an Astro (latest stable) + TypeScript strict (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess`) static site exists at the repo root; npm scripts `dev` (port 4321), `build`, `preview` (port 4321), `typecheck` (`astro check && tsc --noEmit`), `lint` (ESLint flat config incl. astro + typescript plugins), `format:check` (Prettier with prettier-plugin-astro), `test` (Vitest, runs once), `test:e2e` (Playwright), `verify` (`typecheck && lint && format:check && test && build && test:e2e`); `.nvmrc` 22; `.gitignore` adds `dist`, `.astro`, `node_modules`, `test-results`, `playwright-report`, `.e2e`; `site` set to `https://michaelgoldman.dev` via one config constant; CLAUDE.md "Stack" lists every NOTES.md stack choice with installed versions ("(chosen)" for later ones); CLAUDE.md "Start the app for walking it" says `npm run dev` → http://localhost:4321; `npm run typecheck` and `npm run lint` pass.
  - Spec: NOTES.md "Stack preferences", SPEC §7
  - Out of scope: tests beyond an empty Vitest run (PR-2), styling, pages.

- [x] **PR-2 Set up Vitest, Playwright and axe**
  - Done when: Vitest with one passing smoke test; Playwright projects `chromium-desktop` (1440×900), `chromium-phone` (Pixel 7) and `webkit-iphone` (iPhone 14), `webServer` runs `npm run build && npm run preview` on 4321, traces on failure, output under `.e2e/`; `@axe-core/playwright` with a shared `expectNoAxeViolations(page)` helper (WCAG 2.2 AA tags); one passing e2e test loading `/`; `npm run verify` passes.
  - Spec: NOTES.md "Stack preferences", SPEC §7
  - Out of scope: real pages.


## Pruned from the queue

1 finished task(s), moved verbatim by `prune-backlog.py` so the live queue holds only live work.

### Foundation

- [x] **PR-3 Content collections and schemas**
  - Done when: `src/content/config.ts` defines `experience`, `projects`, `certifications`, `education`, `profile` exactly per SPEC §5 with zod, each entry carrying `lang: 'en' | 'nl'`; a build-time check (Vitest test over the collections) fails when any entry exists in one language but not the other, or a field is missing; placeholder minimal EN+NL entries exist so the build passes; every schema has `translated: boolean` (default true) — until PR-48–50, each EN content task also creates the NL twin with the English text and `translated: false`; tests cover the pairing check.
  - Spec: SPEC §3.6, §5
  - Out of scope: real copy (content tasks below).
