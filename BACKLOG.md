# BACKLOG.md

## How this backlog works

`.orchestrator/run.sh` hands each iteration to a fresh agent with no memory of
any previous one. Everything it needs is in this file, `CLAUDE.md`, `SPEC.md`,
`design/`, `docs/`, and the repository itself.

**One task per iteration.** Take the FIRST `- [ ]` line, top to bottom, do it
fully, stop. `.orchestrator/prompt.md` says when consecutive tasks may be
batched; when in doubt, one.

**The checkbox is the only signal.** Flip your task's `- [ ]` to `- [x]` as
your last commit. The loop measures progress by settled checkboxes; a task
implemented and committed but still reading `- [ ]` looks like nothing
happened, and the next agent does it again.

**Blocked, not skipped.** If you genuinely cannot proceed — after checking the
machine for what you think is missing — rewrite the line as
`- [!] <text> - BLOCKED: <reason>` and commit. `- [!]` counts as settled and
the run continues past it. Never weaken a test or silence a failure to make a
task look done.

**Task anatomy.** `- [ ] **ID-n Title**` with nested bullets:
- *Done when* — the acceptance condition; meet all of it.
- *Out of scope* — a boundary. That work belongs to a later task that exists.
- *Spec* — the `SPEC.md` sections or `design/` files that govern this task.
  Read them first; they carry constraints the line does not repeat.

**Splitting.** An iteration is capped at 90 working minutes and loses what is
uncommitted when killed. If your task will not fit, commit what works, give
the shipped part its own `- [x]` line (`ID-n` → `ID-na` done), and add the rest
as `- [ ]` right beneath it with what you learned. Split only when you have
looked and know it will not fit.

**Never invent a decision the spec left to a human.** The TODO-MANUAL section
at the end lists work that needs an account, credential, device, a file only
the owner can supply, or a business decision. Plain bullets, not tasks. If your
task depends on one, that is `- [!] BLOCKED`.

**`- [~]`** marks a task deferred by decision. Never take one or flip one.

**Finished tasks move to `BACKLOG-DONE.md`** automatically between iterations,
verbatim, under the heading they sat beneath. Nothing reads that file as a
queue.

**`CLAUDE.md` outranks your judgement on stack and conventions.**

### Hardening

- [ ] **QA-65 Lighthouse best-practices 0.96 on /education (font size)**
  - Seen by PR-63b's agent, 2026-10-04, and the same on 43466df: `npm run build && npm run lhci` fails the `categories.best-practices` minScore 1 assertion on /education (mobile preset). The `font-size` audit flags 11 px callouts and parts list, plus the 9–11 px title block. Everything else passes.
  - Done when: `npm run lhci` passes on every URL without changing `lighthouserc.json`, and the drawing's look at desktop widths is unchanged.
  - Spec: design/tokens.json type sizes; design/screens education-*-390

- [ ] **QA-66 English parts list scrolls inside its frame at 320–340 px**
  - Seen by QA-65's agent, 2026-10-04, also before its change: at 320 px wide (Chromium, `/education`, reduced motion off, after the explosion settles) `.parts-list-frame` is 228 px wide and its table 251 px (`scrollWidth` 251 > `clientWidth` 228); at 340 px 251 vs 248. NL fits. PartsList.astro's comment promises the table fits a 320 px sheet without scrolling its frame.
  - Done when: at 320 px in EN and NL the parts list fits its frame (`scrollWidth <= clientWidth`), asserted in `tests/e2e/education.spec.ts`'s 320 px fit test, with 12 px type kept from 360 px up (QA-65).
  - Spec: design/components.md parts list; docs/RECORD.md 2026-10-04 responsive pass

### Delivery

- [ ] **PR-55 Dockerfile**
  - Done when: multi-stage Dockerfile (node:22 build → nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged serving `dist/` on 8080) with gzip/brotli-static, long cache headers for hashed assets, no-cache for HTML, 404 page wired, `.dockerignore`; `docker build` + `docker run` smoke test script `scripts/docker-smoke.sh` curls `/`, `/nl/`, an unknown URL (404) — run it if Docker is available, otherwise document; docs/REPO-MAP.md notes it.
  - Spec: NOTES.md "Stack preferences", SPEC §7
  - Out of scope: deploying anywhere.

- [ ] **PR-56 GitHub Actions CI**
  - Done when: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on push/PR: npm ci, typecheck, lint, format check, unit, build, Playwright (with browsers cache), axe, Lighthouse CI, Docker build; uploads `dist/` and the Playwright report as artifacts; concurrency group; README badge; workflow passes on GitHub after push (check with `gh run list`).
  - Spec: NOTES.md "Stack preferences"
  - Out of scope: deploying — `.github/workflows/pages.yml` already does that; leave it alone.

- [ ] **PR-57 README for the repo**
  - Done when: README.md explains the concept (a drawing set), the stack, how to run/test/build, the motion system in two sentences, the pipeline, and links michaelgoldman.dev; includes one screenshot of Sheet 01 (generated by a Playwright script into `docs/`); no AI-hype wording.
  - Spec: SPEC §1
  - Out of scope: —
